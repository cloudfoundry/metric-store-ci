      detailed_description: "Metric Store Release is a BOSH release for Metric Store. It provides a persistent storage layer for metrics sent through the Loggregator subsystem. It is multi-tenant aware (the auth proxy ensures that you only have access to metrics from your apps), easy to query (it is 100% compatible with the Prometheus Query API, with some exceptions listed below), and has a powerful storage engine (the InfluxDB storage engine has built-in compression and a memory-efficient series index)."
